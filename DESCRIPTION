Description: Provides JAR to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference using
    the popular Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees 'BEAST X' software
    library of Baele et al (2025) <doi:10.1038/s41592-025-02751-x>. 'BEAST X' supports
    auto-tuning Metropolis-Hastings, slice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte
    Carlo sampling for a large variety of composable standard and phylogenetic
    statistical models using high performance computing.  By placing the 'BEAST X' JAR in
    this package, we offer an efficient distribution system for 'BEAST X' use by other R
    packages using CRAN.
