Description: Provides JAR to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference using
    the popular Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software library.
    BEAST supports auto-tuning Metropolis-Hastings, slice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    and Sequential Monte Carlo sampling for a large variety of composable standard and
    phylogenetic statistical models using high performance computing.  By placing the
    BEAST JAR in this package, we offer an efficient distribution system for BEAST use
    by other R packages using CRAN.
